### 4-Day Advanced Cohort for Staff+, L8–L10 Engineers

> *"You'll of course be able to design systems like YouTube by the end of this course — but that's not the point. Our focus is on the underlying principles: consistency, concurrency, coordination, and the realities of failure. Once you master those, designing anything becomes a matter of structured thought — not memorized patterns."*  
> **— Chiradip Mandal, Distributed Systems Expert -**

> *"This course is deliberately designed to have academic rigor and industrial strength. Aimed for the professional students who wants to learn and master Distrbuted Systems".

**What You'll Master:**
- **Consistency Models**: Linearizability, causal consistency, eventual consistency with formal analysis
- **Consensus Algorithms**: Raft, Paxos, distributed coordination at scale
- **Scalability Patterns**: Partitioning, replication, isolation with quantitative tradeoff analysis
- **Failure Resilience**: Recovery protocols, observability, and system evolution

**Dates**: August 5, 6, 8, 9, 2025  
**Format**: 4 days × 2 hours (1h theory + 0:30m hands-on GitHub workshops)  
**Includes**: Live sessions, collaborative GitHub projects, lifetime alumni network, early access to *Designing Ultra-Large-Scale Systems* book

**Perfect for**: Staff+, Principal, Distinguished Engineers ready to move beyond interview patterns to principled system design

**Investment**: $1,250 USD
