# System Design for Scale, Failure, and Evolution
## Complete Course Content & Materials

---

## Course Philosophy & Pedagogical Approach

This course employs a **theory-practice synthesis** methodology where each concept is:
1. **Formalized** through rigorous theoretical foundations
2. **Implemented** through hands-on workshops
3. **Validated** through failure simulation and edge case analysis
4. **Critiqued** through peer review and architectural retrospectives

The curriculum is structured around four fundamental pillars:
- **Correctness**: Formal consistency models and their practical implications
- **Scalability**: Systematic approaches to partitioning and replication
- **Coordination**: Consensus algorithms and distributed coordination primitives
- **Evolution**: Designing systems that adapt and survive operational realities

---

## Day 1: Bounded Correctness
*Designing for Correctness under Latency and Failure*

### Learning Objectives
By the end of Day 1, participants will:
- Formalize system boundaries and failure domains using topological reasoning
- Distinguish between consistency models and their operational implications
- Quantify consistency-latency tradeoffs using formal analysis
- Design APIs with explicit consistency contracts

### Morning Session (3 hours): Theoretical Foundations

#### Module 1.1: System Boundaries and Failure Domains (45 min)

**Core Concepts:**
- **Failure Domain Definition**: A failure domain is the maximum scope of impact from a single failure event
- **Topological Constraints**: Physical and logical constraints that govern system behavior
- **Isolation Boundaries**: Mechanisms that prevent failure propagation

**Formal Framework:**
```
Let S = (N, E, F) be a distributed system where:
- N = set of nodes
- E = set of communication edges
- F = set of potential failure modes

A failure domain D ⊆ N is maximal if:
∀f ∈ F: impact(f) ⊆ D and ∄D' ⊃ D such that impact(f) ⊆ D'
```

**Case Study: Netflix's Chaos Engineering**
- Analyze how Netflix maps failure domains to availability zones
- Examine the blast radius calculation for different failure scenarios
- Study the economic model for failure domain sizing

#### Module 1.2: Consistency Models Taxonomy (60 min)

**Consistency Spectrum:**

1. **Strong Consistency**
   - Linearizability: Operations appear to execute atomically at some point between start and completion
   - Sequential Consistency: All operations appear to execute in some sequential order consistent with program order
   - Formal Definition: ∀ operations op₁, op₂: if op₁ completes before op₂ starts, then op₁ appears before op₂ in the linearization

2. **Causal Consistency**
   - Preserves causality: if event A causally precedes event B, then A is observed before B by all processes
   - Vector Clock Implementation: Each process maintains a vector of logical timestamps
   - Formal Definition: ∀ processes p, q: if p observes write w₁ before w₂, then q observes w₁ before w₂ (if q observes both)

3. **Eventual Consistency**
   - Convergence Guarantee: All replicas will eventually converge to the same state
   - No ordering guarantees during convergence period
   - Formal Definition: ∀ replicas r₁, r₂: lim(t→∞) state(r₁, t) = state(r₂, t)

**Deep Dive: Consistency Delay Windows**
- Mathematical model for consistency propagation delay
- Probabilistic analysis of convergence time
- SLA implications of different consistency choices

#### Module 1.3: CAP and PACELC Theorem Analysis (45 min)

**CAP Theorem Formalization:**
```
For any distributed system S:
¬(Consistency ∧ Availability ∧ Partition Tolerance)

More precisely:
- C: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- A: System remains operational despite node failures
- P: System continues despite network partitions
```

**PACELC Extension:**
```
If Partition then (Availability vs Consistency)
Else (Latency vs Consistency)
```

**Quantitative Analysis:**
- Derive consistency probability as function of network reliability
- Calculate expected consistency delay under different replication strategies
- Model the consistency-availability tradeoff surface

#### Module 1.4: Practical Consistency Patterns (30 min)

**Read-After-Write Consistency:**
- Implementation using sticky sessions or monotonic read consistency
- Cost analysis: storage overhead vs consistency guarantees

**Session Consistency:**
- Causal consistency within a session boundary
- Implementation using client-side vector clocks

**Bounded Staleness:**
- Quantified eventual consistency with explicit staleness bounds
- SLA-driven consistency configuration

- Build systems that scale horizontally while maintaining correctness

### Morning Session (3 hours): Scalability Foundations

#### Module 2.1: Partitioning Strategies (75 min)

**Theoretical Framework:**
```
Let D = dataset, P = partition function, N = node set
Goal: Minimize max{|partition(n)| : n ∈ N} while maintaining:
- Query locality
- Load distribution
- Partition tolerance
```

**Partitioning Taxonomies:**

1. **Hash-Based Partitioning**
   - **Consistent Hashing**: Minimizes data movement during node changes
   - **Rendezvous Hashing**: Highest Random Weight (HRW) for better load distribution
   - **Mathematical Analysis**: 
     ```
     Expected load imbalance = O(√(log N / N))
     Data movement on node addition = O(1/N)
     ```

2. **Range-Based Partitioning**
   - **Ordered Partitioning**: Maintains sort order, enables range queries
   - **Hotspot Analysis**: Identify and mitigate hot partitions
   - **Adaptive Splitting**: Dynamic partition boundaries based on load

3. **Directory-Based Partitioning**
   - **Lookup Service**: Centralized vs distributed directory
   - **Caching Strategies**: Directory entry caching and invalidation
   - **Consistency**: Directory updates and data consistency

**Advanced Topics:**
- **Zone-Aware Partitioning**: Optimizing for network topology
- **Workload-Aware Partitioning**: Machine learning-driven partition optimization
- **Multi-Dimensional Partitioning**: Handling queries across multiple dimensions

#### Module 2.2: Replication Protocols (75 min)

**Replication Spectrum:**

1. **Synchronous Replication**
   - **Strong Consistency**: All replicas updated before acknowledgment
   - **Latency Impact**: Write latency = max(replica response times)
   - **Availability Impact**: System unavailable if any replica fails

2. **Asynchronous Replication**
   - **Eventual Consistency**: Replicas updated after acknowledgment
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Last-writer-wins, vector clocks, CRDTs
   - **Replication Lag**: Monitoring and bounding replica drift

3. **Quorum-Based Replication**
   - **Quorum Intersection**: R + W > N ensures consistency
   - **Flexible Quorums**: Tunable consistency vs availability
   - **Mathematical Model**:
     ```
     Consistency Probability = P(R + W > N)
     Availability = P(at least W replicas available for writes)
     ```

**Deep Dive: Replica Lag Management**
- **Lag Monitoring**: Metrics and alerting for replication delays
- **Catch-up Protocols**: Efficient replica recovery mechanisms
- **Read Preference**: Routing reads based on replica freshness

#### Module 2.3: Isolation Levels (30 min)

**ACID Isolation Levels:**

1. **Read Uncommitted**
   - Dirty reads allowed
   - Performance: Highest concurrency, lowest consistency

2. **Read Committed**
   - No dirty reads, but non-repeatable reads possible
   - Implementation: Read locks held only during read operation

3. **Repeatable Read**
   - Consistent snapshot within transaction
   - Phantom reads still possible

4. **Serializable**
   - Strongest isolation level
   - Implementation: Two-phase locking, optimistic concurrency control

**Distributed Isolation Challenges:**
- **Snapshot Isolation**: Consistent global snapshots across partitions
- **Write Skew**: Anomalies in snapshot isolation
- **Distributed Deadlock**: Detection and resolution across nodes

### Afternoon Workshop (1 hour): Sharded Write Path Implementation

#### Objective
Implement a sharded write path with quorum-based replication and simulate failure scenarios.

#### Workshop Structure

**Phase 1: Architecture Design (20 min)**
Design a sharded key-value store with:
- 3 shards using consistent hashing
- 3 replicas per shard with quorum reads/writes (R=2, W=2)
- Failure detection and recovery protocols

**Phase 2: Implementation (30 min)**
Implement core components:

```python
class ShardedKVStore:
    def __init__(self, nodes, replication_factor=3):
        self.ring = ConsistentHashRing(nodes)
        self.replication_factor = replication_factor
        self.quorum_size = 2
    
    def put(self, key, value):
        # 1. Determine shard and replica set
        replicas = self.ring.get_replicas(key, self.replication_factor)
        
        # 2. Coordinate quorum write
        responses = []
        for replica in replicas:
            try:
                response = replica.write(key, value, timestamp=time.now())
                responses.append(response)
            except NetworkError:
                continue
        
        # 3. Check quorum success
        if len(responses) >= self.quorum_size:
            return WriteResult.SUCCESS
        else:
            return WriteResult.INSUFFICIENT_REPLICAS
    
    def get(self, key):
        # 1. Determine replica set
        replicas = self.ring.get_replicas(key, self.replication_factor)
        
        # 2. Coordinate quorum read
        responses = []
        for replica in replicas:
            try:
                response = replica.read(key)
                responses.append(response)
            except NetworkError:
                continue
        
        # 3. Resolve conflicts and return latest value
        if len(responses) >= self.quorum_size:
            return self.resolve_conflicts(responses)
        else:
            return ReadResult.INSUFFICIENT_REPLICAS
```

## Day 3: Time, Coordination, and Recovery
*Consensus, Clocks, Durable Recovery*

### Learning Objectives
- Implement consensus algorithms for distributed coordination
- Design clock synchronization systems for distributed ordering
- Build durable recovery mechanisms with consistency guarantees
- Analyze the fundamental limits of distributed coordination

### Morning Session (3 hours): Coordination Foundations

#### Module 3.1: Consensus Algorithms (90 min)

**Consensus Problem Formalization:**
```
Given a set of processes P = {p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ}, each with an initial value vᵢ,
find an algorithm that ensures:
1. Termination: Every correct process eventually decides
2. Validity: If all processes propose the same value v, then v is decided
3. Agreement: No two correct processes decide differently
```

**The FLP Impossibility Result:**
- **Theorem**: No deterministic consensus algorithm can guarantee termination in an asynchronous system with even one faulty process
- **Practical Implications**: Why randomization or failure detectors are necessary
- **Circumvention Strategies**: Partial synchrony, timeouts, leader election

**Raft Consensus Algorithm:**

1. **Leader Election**
   ```
   def start_election():
       current_term += 1
       vote_for = self.id
       votes_received = 1
       
       for peer in peers:
           if peer.request_vote(current_term, last_log_index, last_log_term):
               votes_received += 1
       
       if votes_received > len(peers) / 2:
           become_leader()
   ```

2. **Log Replication**
   ```
   def append_entries(term, leader_id, prev_log_index, prev_log_term, entries):
       if term < current_term:
           return False
       
       if log[prev_log_index].term != prev_log_term:
           return False
       
       # Append new entries
       log[prev_log_index + 1:] = entries
       return True
   ```

3. **Safety Properties**
   - **Election Safety**: At most one leader per term
   - **Leader Append-Only**: Leaders never overwrite log entries
   - **Log Matching**: Identical entries at same index across logs
   - **Leader Completeness**: Committed entries appear in all future leader logs

**Multi-Raft for Scaling:**
- **Partition-Based Raft**: Each partition runs independent Raft group
- **Cross-Partition Coordination**: Distributed transactions across Raft groups
- **Leader Placement**: Optimizing leader distribution for load balancing

#### Module 3.2: Distributed Time and Clocks (45 min)

**Time in Distributed Systems:**

1. **Physical Clocks**
   - **Clock Skew**: Differences in physical clock rates
   - **Clock Synchronization**: NTP, PTP protocols
   - **Drift Compensation**: Adjusting for hardware clock drift

2. **Logical Clocks**
   - **Lamport Timestamps**: Scalar logical clocks
   - **Vector Clocks**: Causal ordering preservation
   - **Hybrid Logical Clocks (HLC)**: Combining physical and logical time

3. **Google's TrueTime**
   - **Time Interval API**: `TT.now()` returns [earliest, latest]
   - **External Consistency**: Transactions appear to execute at TrueTime
   - **Uncertainty Management**: Waiting out clock uncertainty

**Clock Synchronization Protocols:**
```python
class HybridLogicalClock:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logical_time = 0
        self.physical_time = 0
    
    def send_event(self):
        self.physical_time = time.time()
        self.logical_time = max(self.logical_time, self.physical_time)
        self.logical_time += 1
        return (self.logical_time, self.physical_time)
    
    def receive_event(self, remote_logical, remote_physical):
        self.physical_time = time.time()
        self.logical_time = max(
            self.logical_time,
            remote_logical,
            self.physical_time
        ) + 1
```

#### Module 3.3: Durable Recovery Mechanisms (45 min)

**Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):**
- **Logging Protocol**: All changes logged before application
- **Recovery Protocol**: Replay log entries after failure
- **Checkpointing**: Periodic snapshots to bound recovery time

**Fencing Tokens:**
- **Problem**: Preventing split-brain scenarios
- **Solution**: Monotonically increasing tokens for resource access
- **Implementation**: Distributed lock services with fencing

**Log Compaction Strategies:**
1. **Snapshot-Based**: Periodic full state snapshots
2. **Incremental**: Delta-based compaction
3. **Hybrid**: Combining snapshots with incremental updates

**Recovery Scenarios:**
- **Single Node Failure**: Log replay and state reconstruction
- **Correlated Failures**: Multi-node recovery coordination
- **Data Center Failures**: Cross-region recovery and consistency

### Afternoon Workshop (1 hour): Raft Implementation

#### Objective
Implement core Raft consensus algorithm with leadership election and log replication.

#### Workshop Structure

**Phase 1: State Machine Design (15 min)**
Design the Raft state machine:
```python
class RaftNode:
    def __init__(self, node_id, peers):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.peers = peers
        self.state = NodeState.FOLLOWER
        
        # Persistent state
        self.current_term = 0
        self.voted_for = None
        self.log = []
        
        # Volatile state
        self.commit_index = 0
        self.last_applied = 0
        
        # Leader state
        self.next_index = {}
        self.match_index = {}
```

**Phase 2: Leader Election (25 min)**
Implement leader election protocol:
```python
def request_vote(self, term, candidate_id, last_log_index, last_log_term):
    # Check term validity
    if term < self.current_term:
        return VoteResponse(self.current_term, False)
    
    # Update term if necessary
    if term > self.current_term:
        self.current_term = term
        self.voted_for = None
        self.state = NodeState.FOLLOWER
    
    # Check if we can vote for this candidate
    if (self.voted_for is None or self.voted_for == candidate_id) and \
       self.is_log_up_to_date(last_log_index, last_log_term):
        self.voted_for = candidate_id
        return VoteResponse(self.current_term, True)
    
    return VoteResponse(self.current_term, False)
```

**Phase 3: Log Replication (15 min)**
Implement log replication for followers:
```python
def append_entries(self, term, leader_id, prev_log_index, prev_log_term, entries, leader_commit):
    # Term check
    if term < self.current_term:
        return AppendEntriesResponse(self.current_term, False)
    
    # Reset election timeout
    self.reset_election_timeout()
    
    # Log consistency check
    if prev_log_index > 0 and \
       (len(self.log) < prev_log_index or self.log[prev_log_index - 1].term != prev_log_term):
        return AppendEntriesResponse(self.current_term, False)
    
    # Append entries
    self.log[prev_log_index:] = entries
    
    # Update commit index
    if leader_commit > self.commit_index:
        self.commit_index = min(leader_commit, len(self.log))
    
    return AppendEntriesResponse(self.current_term, True)
```

## Day 4: Architectural Evolution
*Designing for Change and Long-Term Resilience*

### Learning Objectives
- Design observable systems with comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Implement backward-compatible system evolution strategies
- Build systems that gracefully handle operational changes
- Synthesize course learnings into architectural principles

### Morning Session (3 hours): Evolution and Observability

#### Module 4.1: Observability-First Design (90 min)

**The Three Pillars of Observability:**

1. **Metrics**
   - **Business Metrics**: Request rate, error rate, latency percentiles
   - **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
   - **Application Metrics**: Custom business logic measurements

2. **Logging**
   - **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with consistent fields
   - **Distributed Tracing**: Request correlation across service boundaries
   - **Log Aggregation**: Centralized log collection and analysis

3. **Tracing**
   - **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracking
   - **Span Context**: Propagating trace context across services
   - **Sampling Strategies**: Reducing trace volume while maintaining coverage

**Service Level Objectives (SLOs):**
```
SLO = Target reliability level based on user experience
SLI = Service Level Indicator (actual measurement)
SLA = Service Level Agreement (business commitment)

Example SLO:
- 99.9% of requests complete within 100ms
- 99.99% availability measured over 30-day window
- Error rate < 0.1% for all user-facing requests
```

**Error Budget Management:**
- **Error Budget**: Amount of unreliability tolerated by SLO
- **Burn Rate**: Rate at which error budget is consumed
- **Alerting**: Trigger alerts when burn rate exceeds threshold

**Observability Implementation Patterns:**
```python
class ObservableService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = MetricsCollector()
        self.logger = StructuredLogger()
        self.tracer = DistributedTracer()
    
    def handle_request(self, request):
        with self.tracer.start_span("handle_request") as span:
            span.set_tag("request_id", request.id)
            
            start_time = time.time()
            try:
                result = self.process_request(request)
                
                # Record success metrics
                self.metrics.increment("requests_total", tags={"status": "success"})
                self.metrics.histogram("request_duration", time.time() - start_time)
                
                self.logger.info("Request processed successfully", 
                               {"request_id": request.id, "duration": time.time() - start_time})
                
                return result
                
            except Exception as e:
                # Record error metrics
                self.metrics.increment("requests_total", tags={"status": "error"})
                self.metrics.increment("errors_total", tags={"error_type": type(e).__name__})
                
                self.logger.error("Request processing failed", 
                                {"request_id": request.id, "error": str(e)})
                
                span.set_tag("error", True)
                span.log_kv({"error.message": str(e)})
                
                raise
```

#### Module 4.2: Backward Compatibility and API Evolution (45 min)

**Compatibility Strategies:**

1. **Dual Writes**
   - **Pattern**: Write to both old and new systems during migration
   - **Validation**: Compare results to ensure consistency
   - **Rollback**: Ability to revert to old system if issues arise

2. **API Versioning**
   - **URL Versioning**: `/v1/users` vs `/v2/users`
   - **Header Versioning**: `Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=2`
   - **Parameter Versioning**: `?version=2.0`

3. **Schema Evolution**
   - **Forward Compatibility**: New code can read old data
   - **Backward Compatibility**: Old code can read new data
   - **Schema Registry**: Centralized schema management

**Database Migration Patterns:**
```python
class DatabaseMigration:
    def __init__(self):
        self.old_db = OldDatabase()
        self.new_db = NewDatabase()
        
    def dual_write_migration(self, data):
