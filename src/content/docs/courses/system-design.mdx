title: "System Design for Scale, Failure, and Evolution"
description: "4-Day Advanced System Design Cohort for Staff+, L8–L10 Engineers"
---

> **“You’ll of course be able to design systems like YouTube by the end of this course — but that’s not the point. Our focus is on the underlying principles: consistency, concurrency, coordination, and the realities of failure. Once you master those, designing anything becomes a matter of structured thought — not memorized patterns.”**  
> — **Chiradip Mandal**

## Overview

- **Duration**: 4 Days × 2 Hours/day  
- **Format**: 1.5h deep dive + 30m hands-on GitHub workshop  
- **Target**: Staff+, Principal, L8–L10 engineers  
- **Pedagogy**: Theory + application + architecture retrospectives  
- **Deliverables**: GitHub architecture, design docs, book access  
- **Post-Cohort**: Design circles, long-term cohort mentorship

---

## Learning Goals

- Master architectural tradeoffs: consistency, concurrency, consensus  
- Build systems with realistic latency, failure, resource constraints  
- Collaboratively evolve an architecture via GitHub PRs  
- Join a durable network of peer reviewers, technologists, and system leaders

---

## Day-by-Day Syllabus

### Day 1 — Bounded Correctness
**Theme**: Designing for Correctness under Latency and Failure

- System boundaries, failure domains, topological constraints
- Consistency models: strong, causal, eventual, linearizable
- Tradeoffs: CAP, PACELC, consistency delay windows
- **Workshop**: Design a log-backed API with defined consistency contract

**Readings**:
- Lamport — *Time, Clocks and the Ordering of Events*  
- Jepsen — *Consistency Models Explained*

---

### Day 2 — Scalability Through Structure
**Theme**: Partitioning, Replication, and Isolation

- Sharding: consistent hashing, prefix-based, zone-aware
- Replication: quorum, async vs sync, follower lag
- Isolation levels: snapshot, serializable, write-skew
- **Workshop**: Implement sharded write path, simulate stale read and recovery

**Readings**:
- *Spanner: Globally Distributed DB* — Google  
- *Dynamo: Amazon's Highly Available Key-Value Store*

---

### Day 3 — Time, Coordination, and Recovery
**Theme**: Consensus, Clocks, Durable Recovery

- Raft, Paxos, Multi-Raft, Viewstamped Replication
- Clocks: vector, HLC, skew compensation, leases
- WALs, fencing tokens, log truncation, snapshotting
- **Workshop**: Add Raft-style leadership and recovery to cohort service

**Readings**:
- Ongaro — *In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm*  
- *Viewstamped Replication Revisited*

---

### Day 4 — Architectural Evolution
**Theme**: Designing for Change and Long-Term Resilience

- Observability-first systems: metrics, traces, health budgets
- Backward compatibility: dual writes, API evolution
- Patterns: outbox, changelogs, control planes
- **Capstone**: Extend your system — add observability, snapshot versioning, or rolling upgrades
- **Collaboration**: Initiate a cohort-authored short paper on "System Thinking in Distributed Design" — synthesize cohort insights into a public artifact

**Readings**:
- *Eventual Consistency & The Outbox Pattern*

---


## GitHub Architecture Project

This project spans all four days and simulates the evolution of a fault-tolerant distributed system through collaborative GitHub milestones. Each team will maintain:

- A `design.md` document with architecture decisions, consistency contracts, and tradeoff reasoning
- Annotated PRs referencing coordination logic, recovery strategies, and observability instrumentation
- Structured issues reflecting real-world failure modes, SLO constraints, and coordination boundaries

| Day | Milestone |
|-----|-----------|
| 1   | Formalize system API surface with specified consistency contracts (linearizability, causal, etc.) |
| 2   | Apply structured sharding (range/hash) and implement write quorum coordination logic |
| 3   | Integrate Raft-style log coordination, leader election, and recovery fencing |
| 4   | Extend system with metrics, traces, snapshots; finalize capstone and contribute to cohort-authored paper |

Each team maintains a repo with versioned design.md and issue-based planning.

:::note 
Only foundational programming proficiency is expected — the course prioritizes algorithmic thinking, systems reasoning, and correctness over language-specific implementation.

## Instructor

### Chiradip Mandal
**Writer • Distributed Systems Researcher • Founder • Senior Architect • Principal Engineer**

Chiradip has led architecture at both hyperscale companies and startups. His experience includes:
- Multi-time founder and systems advisor
- Author of the upcoming book *Designing Ultra-Large-Scale Systems*
- Senior Principal Engineer/Architect at Apple

> _“I’m not here to teach you how to design YouTube. I’m here to help you reason about consistency, concurrency, and failure — and use that reasoning to architect things that don’t fall apart.”_

---

## Bonuses & Cohort Continuity

- Early access to *Designing Ultra-Large-Scale Systems* (pre-release reviewer)  
- Private Slack/Discord community for long-term mentorship  
- Access to follow-up tracks: CRDTs, streaming architectures, infra control planes  
- Peer design reviews + optional architecture office hours
- Publishing high-quality research papers through SystemDesignSchool.com and its partners

---

## Expectations

- Attend all 4 days fully; every module builds on the last  
- Push to GitHub daily and participate in peer reviews  
- Be prepared to defend design tradeoffs in live discussions  
- Build not for interviews — but for systems that survive failure and time
